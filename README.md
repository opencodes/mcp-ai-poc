# How Combining MCP Tools Can Supercharge Complex Projects

In today’s fast-paced software landscape, managing complexity is a constant challenge. As projects grow, so does the need for automation, integration, and intelligent tooling. Enter **MCP (Modular Command Platform)** tools—a new paradigm for building, combining, and orchestrating automation in your projects.

In this article, I’ll share how combining MCP tools can help you tackle complex projects with ease, using a practical example: listing files and reading the README from any public GitHub repository with just a few lines of code.

## What Are MCP Tools?

MCP tools are modular, Python-based components that expose functionality as reusable, discoverable commands. They can be registered, composed, and orchestrated—making it easy to automate workflows, integrate with APIs, and build intelligent systems.

---

## Why Combine MCP Tools?

- **Reusability:** Each tool does one thing well and can be reused across projects.
- **Composability:** Tools can be chained together to build complex workflows.
- **Maintainability:** Modular code is easier to test, debug, and extend.
- **Collaboration:** Teams can share and combine tools, accelerating development.

## Example: Listing GitHub Files and Reading the README with MCP

Let’s look at a real-world example from our [mcp-ai-poc](https://github.com/your-org/mcp-ai-poc) project.

Suppose you want to build an API that lists all files in a public GitHub repo and reads its README. With MCP, you can create tools for this in minutes:

### 1. List Files in a GitHub Repository

````python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from lib import list_files_from_github_url

mcp = FastMCP("mcp-poc", "0.1.0", "A simple MCP server for listing GitHub files")

@mcp.tool
def list_files_in_git_repo(repo: str):
    """List public GitHub repository files"""
    return list_files_from_github_url(repo)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
````

### 2. Read the README File

````python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from lib import read_readme_from_github

mcp = FastMCP("mcp-readme", "0.1.0", "A simple MCP server for reading GitHub README files")

@mcp.tool
def read_the_readme_file(repo: str):
    """Read the README file from a public GitHub repository"""
    return read_readme_from_github(repo)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
````

Both tools are registered in your configuration and ready for use. This modular approach lets you easily add more tools and combine their capabilities for complex workflows.

## Real-World Benefits

- **Automate tedious tasks:** Chain tools to fetch files, analyze code, and generate reports.
- **Integrate with AI:** Use MCP tools as building blocks for AI agents that reason about codebases.
- **Scale with your team:** Share tools across teams and projects, reducing duplication.

---

## Get Started

1. **Modularize your logic:** Break down your project into reusable MCP tools.
2. **Register and compose:** Use FastMCP or similar frameworks to register and combine tools.
3. **Automate workflows:** Orchestrate tools to automate complex tasks.

---

## Conclusion

Combining MCP tools unlocks a new level of productivity and maintainability for complex projects. By modularizing functionality and enabling easy composition, you can automate more, collaborate better, and build smarter systems.
